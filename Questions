1) What Are the Basic Elements of a SQL Query?
Solution: -  The exact structure of each SQL query will obviously depend on the problem you are trying to solve.
      However, there are some basic elements that form most SQL queries. SELECT,  FROM,  JOIN,  WHERE,  GROUP BY, 
       HAVING, and ORDER BY are common elements of a SQL query.

2) What Is the SQL WHERE clause? 
Solution: - WHERE is applied after the FROM or JOIN statements. It retrieves those records that meet the specified condition.

3) How Does GROUP BY Work?
Solution: - The GROUP BY clause groups records with the same values in a given column. For example, 
            if you wrote GROUP BY department, all employees with the same value in the department column 
             would be one group.

4) Name and Explain Some Common Aggregate Functions ? 
Solution: - In SQL, an aggregate function uses the data from multiple rows to calculate a single result.
           Common aggregate functions:::
            COUNT:- returns the number of rows.
            SUM:- returns the sum of all values in that column.
            AVG:- returns the average value.
            MIN: - returns the smallest value.
            MAX: - returns the largest value.
